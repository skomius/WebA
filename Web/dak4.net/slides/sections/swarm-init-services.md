# Docker Swarm 101

---

[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) is the clustering technology built into Docker. We'll use it to introduce the concepts of orchestration.

In production environments you can build a Docker Swarm cluster from four servers, and grow up to thousands of worker nodes.

You can also run a single-node swarm for dev and test environments.

---

## Clean up all containers

We don't need any of the running containers, so we'll remove them all.

```
docker container rm --force `
  $(docker container ls --quiet --all)
```

> The `$()` syntax joins commands together. PowerShell uses the pipe `|` but this syntax also works in Linux shells.

---

## Switch to swarm mode

A single node swarm gives you all the functionality of swarm mode, but without high availability or the opportunity to scale and use more compute.

_Switching to swarm mode is easy:_

```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 127.0.0.1
```

> Your RDP session will flicker here. That's to do with a network shift Windows does to support networking in swarm mode.

---

## Now you're a swarm of one

That makes your node a swarm manager. The output is the command you would use to join other nodes to the swarm, but for now we'll stick with a single node.

Shortly we'll deploy the workshop app to the swarm, but before that we'll just explore swarm mode with some simple services.

> Services are the unit of deployment in swarm mode. You don't run containers, you create services which Docker deploys as containers on the swarm.

---

## Creating services

You can create services imperatively with the command line, or declaratively using compose files.

_Create a simple service which pings itself:_

```
docker service create `
  --entrypoint "ping -t localhost" `
  --name pinger mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
```

> The declarative approach is better. We'll use that for the final app.

---

## Managing services

Services are a first-class resource in swarm mode. You can list services, list the containers running the service (called "tasks"), and check the logs for the service:

```
docker service ls

docker service ps pinger

docker service logs pinger
```

---

## Scaling services

Services are an abstraction over containers. You could have a swarm with 100 nodes, and you don't care which node is running which containers. You just specify a service level, and the swarm maintains it. 

_Scale up the service by running more replicas:_

```
docker service update --replicas=3 pinger
```

> Scaling up the service adds more task containers. This is a single node swarm so they will all be running on your VM, but it's the same command for a swarm of any size.

---

## Check the new service tasks

You can see the extra tasks, and their logs:

```
docker service ps pinger

docker service logs pinger
```

> Tasks are just the name for containers in a service. You'll see the logs listed with the task ID, prefixed with the number - `pinger.1...`

---

## Updating services

Swarm mode supports automatic updates. You upgrade your app by updating the service with a new image. 

This is a zero-downtime update for services with multiple replicas, because Docker replaces one container at a time, so your app stays available.

_Update the image for the `pinger` service: _

```
docker service update --detach `
  --image  mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019 pinger
```

> This updates the container image. The start command is still the same, so when new tasks start, they will run the original command. 

---

## Rolling service updates

Check the task list for the service, and you can see the rollout happens gradually. 

Some containers will be using the original definition with Nano Server, and some will be using Windows Server Core:

```
docker service ps pinger
```

> Docker ensures new tasks are healthy before carrying on with the rollout. You have [fine control](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/rolling-update/) over how the rollout happens.

---

## Inspecting swarm services

The service definition is stored in the swarm, securely persisted among the manager nodes. 

_Check the service details: _

```
docker service inspect pinger
```

> Docker Swarm is built from the open-source SwarmKit project - [docker/swarmkit]()

---

## Rollback the service update

Swarm saves the service definition, so you can easily rollback an update if the new version of the app has a problem. 

You don't need to use a compose file, because the swarm has all the details.

```
docker service update --rollback pinger
```

---

## Rolling rollbacks

The rollback happens in the same way, with task containers being replaced with versions using the original definition:

```
docker service ps pinger
```

And you can see the logs are still collected from all the containers:

```
docker service logs pinger
```

---

## Removing the service

The service is the unit you manage. When you don't need it any more, you remove the service and Docker stops all the containers:

```
docker service rm pinger
```

> This also removes the service configuration from the swarm, so there's no going back.

---

## Services in HA swarms

Production swarm clusters typically have 3 manager nodes for high availability, and as many worker nodes as you need for your workloads.

One swarm can be a cluster of hundreds of worker nodes, and you manage your services in exactly the same way for any size of swarm. You can even mix Linux and Windows, Intel and ARM processors in the same swarm.

Docker takes care of service levels, so if a server goes down and takes containers with it, Docker spins up replacements on other nodes.

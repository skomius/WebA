### Pre-requisites

If you want to follow along with the workshop you will need

- Windows 10 with [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), or 
- Windows Server 2019 with [Docker Enterprise](https://docs.docker.com/install/windows/docker-ee/).

You will build images and push them to Docker Hub during the workshop, so they are available to use later. You'll need a Docker ID to push images.

- Sign up for a free Docker ID on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

## Use process isolation

Windows 10 runs containers in a slightly different way from Windows Server. If you're using Windows 10 it's good to switch to the standard server functionality.

Open _Settings_ from the Docker icon, select _Daemon_ and flick the _Advanced_ switch. Then paste this JSON config and click _Apply_:

```
{
  "debug": true,
  "experimental": false,
  "exec-opts": [
    "isolation=process"
  ]
}
```

---

## Now - get the code

All the source code for the workshop is on GitHub at [sixeyed/dak4.net](https://github.com/sixeyed/dak4.net)

_Open a PowerShell prompt from the start menu and run:_

```
git clone https://github.com/sixeyed/dak4.net.git
```

> **Do not use PowerShell ISE for the workshop!** It has a strange relationship with some `docker` commands.

---

## Set up your environment

Just to make the workflow easier, set up an environment variable for the path to your workshop code.

_In your same PowerShell session run:_

```
$env:workshop="$(pwd)\dak4.net"

cd $env:workshop
```

> You can always get back to the root of the repo by running `cd $env:workshop`

## We're ready!

Here we go :)
